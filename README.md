## üéÆ About The Project

This is a web-based implementation of the classic electronic memory game, "Simon Says." The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex, challenging the player's short-term memory.
